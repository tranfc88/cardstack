# @cardstack/github-auth

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd @cardstack/github-auth`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

To run the demo app and interact with GitHub, you need to register your app via https://github.com/settings/developers and get a client ID & secret. Set them via the environment variables `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. This allows this plugin to act as an OAuth2 client that speaks to GitHub on behalf of users who authorize it.

For the present, you also need a user token that the Hub can use to represent itself. You can use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure that this token has `repo` scope, and push permissions on the GitHub repos that you configure to use with the github-auth plugin datasource. This allows the plugin to have sufficient privileges to be able to query the repo for collaborator permissions. Set is via the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
